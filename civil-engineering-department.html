				DEPARTMENT PROFILE
			</p>
			<p>
				Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design,construction and maintenance of the physically built structures like bridges, roads, canals, dams and buildings etc. and also it will take care of naturally built environment.
				Civil engineering is the oldest engineering discipline and it has several sub-disciplines including environmental engineering,
				geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, transportation engineering, water resources engineering, materials engineering, coastal engineering,surveying, and construction engineering.
				Civil engineering is the broadest of the engineering fields. Civil engineers build the worldâ€™s infrastructure. It is an age-old profession and has been defined traditionally as a great art, on which the wealth and the well-being of the whole of society depend.
