			<strong>The Man Who Dared to Dream</strong><br>
			<p>Sri. T. John, Educationist, Social Worker, Philanthropist and Visionary. A man who strived tirelessly to impart general and professional education to all sections of society. Out of this dedication and perseverance was born the Marougen Education Foundation incorporated as a Registered Society in 1988 by his son Dr. Thomas P John.</p>
			<p>Now his vision has grown to encompass a college with varied courses, all designed along professional lines, to give you the privilege of a sound education and a fine foundation for your future career.</p>
			<p>This has come about due to the liberal contribution from Sri. T. John who has donated 20 Acres of land to the Marougen Education Foundation.</p>
